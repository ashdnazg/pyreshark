Building Pyreshark
------------------
Currently the plugin was tested on win32, win64 and some linux distro's.

Win32/64 Instructions:

    1. Get Wireshark's source. (version 1.12 or 1.10 is required)
    2. Build Wireshark.
    3. Get pyreshark's source through hg clone.
    4. Place pyreshark's source in the plugins dir of Wireshark's source.
    5. Go to <WS_source_root>\plugins\pyreshark and run:
        nmake -f Makefile.nmake all
    6. If all went well, you can now copy the shiny new pyreshark.dll and python folder to your Wireshark installation.

Linux Instructions:
    1. Get Wireshark's source.
    2. Get pyreshark's source through hg clone.
    3. Place pyreshark's source in the plugins dir of Wireshark's source.
    4. If your Python dynamic library isn't named libpython2.*.so.1.0 or isn't in the search path, 
       change the PYTHON_* values in python_loader.h to the correct full path of the library.
    5. Follow the instructions in http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/doc/README.plugins
    6. Build Wireshark and install it.
    7. If all went well, you should have the plugin installed as well.
